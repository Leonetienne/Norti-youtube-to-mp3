# Moodle dark theme
I wanted a dark-theme for moodle so i made this lol

This custom stylesheet is specifically made for the Moodle installation of [Hochschule Worms](https://www.hs-worms.de). It may or may not work with other instances.

!!! This is an alpha version!! It is highly likely that there are some classes that are not yet or only partially "darkened" which can lead to bad readability (such as white background + white font).

## How to install
1) Download the repository root somewhere
2) If zipped, extract it
3) Go to your chrome extension settings (`chrome://extensions`)
4) If needed, adjust your moodle url in `manifest.json`
5) Click "Load unzipped extension" or whatever it reads in english. The left button...
6) Select the repository root directory
7) Profit.
...
8) Every time you change something in the extension source, you have to click reload on the settings page (`chrome://extensions`), and then refresh the affected tabs for it to take effect.
