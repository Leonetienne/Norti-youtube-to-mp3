# Chrome Extension for Tubio
Adds a context-menu and a popup to download videos instantly.  
It does not open tubio for you. It just downloads the videos.  

For now this is not on the chrome store, but you can easily install unlisted extensions from source as shown [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=Click%20the%20Chrome%20menu%20icon,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).
