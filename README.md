This project is a semi-automatic youtube to mp3 converter.
It does only work, if you have the youtube-dl.exe and ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe and ffprobe.exe binaries in the root directory of the main executeable.
These are not mine, but they are licensed in a way that i can include them in the project, so no source code for them.

You can leave this application running in the background. As soon as you copy any youtube link, it will automatically download it to mp3 format.
Mp3 files will be saved in a "Downloads" folder in the root directory of the main executeable.

If you want to download an entire playlist at once, you just have to type PLAYLIST somewhere into the url of a playlist.
(This way you can quickly download single videos out of a playlist by just copying the url)



This project is NOT entirely mine! My project is based on these four binaries that are NOT mine:
youtube-dl.exe binary is from https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/ and is released under public domain.
ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe and ffprobe.exe binaries are copyrighted by Fabrice Bellard and released under the gnu - general public license


The C++ project (without the before mentioned four binaries) are licensed under gnu - general public license.
You may redistribute it (under the same license),
you may display it,
you may copy it,
you may modify it,
as long as you do not sub-license it or say it is your own.
